add more data points to the database:
- cheater's favorite classes (add checkbox for all classes, do they play sniper, engie...)
- cheater on a burner or main account?
- has a previous vac ban on record?
- cheater won/lost the game?
- was cheater kicked?
- uses microphone*
- uses text chat
- attempts to kick other players
- says something racist
DONE

NEXT STEP:
add a notification when the entry submission is good or fails.

create a separate page that displays all of the most recent cheaters in a table of 10 entries per page.
see if you can query steam's API to get the user's profile pic and other information to display
also try to create a search bar that lets you search by certain filters (?)
