NEXT ON DA CHOPPING BLOCK:
==========================
1. if profile is private, skip the game hours

2. write a sql transaction that verifies if the user's URL already exists in the db. if so, respond accordingly with "user already exists"

3. add some validation for christs sake you can send anything right now and it goes through.

========

4. create a separate page that displays all of the most recent cheaters in a table of 10 entries per page.

5. also try to create a search bar that queries the db and lets you search by profile url

6. WRITE A PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE THAT TAKES ALL THE INFO FROM MY PRIVATE DB AND UPDATES
THE WEBSITE'S GRAPHS N SHIT ONCE PER DAY BASED ON ALL CURRENT INFO LOL BRING ON THE PACKET FLOODERS



RANDOM SHIT I CAME UP WITH FOR A VIDEO:
=======================================
cheaters are all disabled braindead retards
that dont' know how to press WASD and click their mouse
in the correct order to win a game. they're all fuckin stupid
idiots that spend loads of money on bitcoin mining malware
that they have no idea is stealing their personal data
just to get raped by sweaty tryhards in game anyway.
they're fuckin DUMB as shit.

use the nerd emoji voice with the following while displaying clips of obvious cheating ocurring:
'um, how can you be absolutely certain these people were cheating
because clearly if you were an actual player like me who has
excellent motor skills and the intelligence to determine real
cheating, you would know that most of these people probably
were just better than you and you got rekt because you lack
even a modicum of experience playing the game in any type
of professional environment. edit: thanks for the updoots
kind stranger! edit 2: please stop asking me to kill myself, im not weak 
minded like some of you pathetic simpletons.'

play some funny nintendo music or some calm jazz over this narration



SHIT THAT'S DONE:
=================
add more data points to the database:
- cheater's favorite classes (add checkbox for all classes, do they play sniper, engie...)
- cheater on a burner or main account?
- has a previous vac ban on record?
- cheater won/lost the game?
- was cheater kicked?
- uses microphone*
- uses text chat
- attempts to kick other players
- says something racist
DONE

NEXT STEP:
add a notification when the entry submission is good or fails.
DONE

make the server log a more verbose log when data is entered instead of just 'entry added: 1'
DONE

add columns for degenerate shit
make a backup of current db before adding these columns
DONE

1. query steam's API to get the user's profile pic, vac status, trade ban status, community ban status, private profile status,
account creation date, tf2 game hours, steam level and then autofill all the respective fields with this info so i dont fuckin have to
